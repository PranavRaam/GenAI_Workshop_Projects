    Text Classification with Pre-trained Models: Classify text with BERT, RoBERTa or DistilBERT with only minimal fine-tuning: Real-world adaptability/
    Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A chatbot which uses generative models combined with retrieval for the production of accurate and relevant responses.
    Image Captioning with Vision-Language Models: Describe images using models that bridge vision and language, such as CLIP .
    Summarization System with T5 or BART: Take long texts and produce good summaries for reading quickly.
    Question Answering with Dense Retrieval + BERT: Retrieve answers from text by using dense retrieval techniques combined with BERT .
    Text Generation with GPT-3/4: Fine-tune GPT-3/4 to generate more human-like text for creative or task-specific outputs.
    Text-to-Speech System using Quantized Models: Generate speech from text of high quality using an efficient, quantized model.
    Multilingual Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis of any text to infer its sentiment across languages using cross-lingual models like XLM-R or mBERT.
    Few Shot Learning for Image Classification: Classify using very few labeled data using methods such as prototypical networks.
    Quantization of Neural Networks: Reduce the model size and speed up inference by quantizing neural networks.
